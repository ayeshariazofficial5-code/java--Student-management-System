# ðŸŽ“ Student Management System (Java)

A simple Student Management System console application built in Java. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Classes, Objects, and ArrayLists. The system allows you to add new students with ID, Name, and Age, view all students, search for a student by ID, delete a student by ID, and provides a simple and user-friendly console interface.  

Here are some screenshots of the project in action:
